When you think you need a Privacy Policy (or when you got an email from Facebook telling you should), you’ll need to get your hands on a privacy policy. On record, I want to say that it’s always best to hire someone with legal knowledge to help you in this matter.

Of-record, I can say that there are various tools and websites that can help you creating a Privacy Policy that will be suitable for your Facebook Apps. Facebook even recommends this, since they’re pointing to this page. There are also various (free) privacy policies generators online, such as generateprivacypolicy.com & freeprivacypolicy.com.

Please note that I’m not a lawyer and I don’t have any legal experience. When you want to be certain, please seek advice from someone with legal knowledge.
